While he is thoroughly cynical and nihilistic, he is at the same time devoted and protective, and even a little childish to the point that it makes him hard to hate. He does not lie, but he does keep secrets and tell half truths. He means well and is capable of being nice, but often ends up being sarcastic, especially so when he gives advice."

She is always faithful to her Master, showing that she is one of the most loyal servants. She is not openly talkative, and she prefers to analyze people and their actions. She is very logical and she does not act out of anger or instinct. Despite her self possessed nature she is insecure about her looks, not believing that she is beautiful because she isn't cute. An aspect of the sultry side of her personality, Rider behaves in a very sedutive manner and is exceptionally flirtatious. Rider is especially aggressive when she flirts with someone she has feelings for often overbearingly so.`

She doesn't like to be called a "witch", and while she will forgive someone once, she will prepare an appropriate punishment for those who call her a "witch" twice.`
